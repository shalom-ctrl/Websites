      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Child marriage remains one of the most heartbreaking violations of human rights worldwide. It cuts short a girl’s education, limits her opportunities, and exposes her to early motherhood and abuse. Despite global awareness, millions of girls are still being married off before they turn 18, especially in developing regions.</p>

      <h2>Causes of Child Marriage</h2>
      <p>The practice often stems from poverty, gender inequality, and cultural traditions. Families struggling financially may see early marriage as a way to reduce economic burden. In some societies, it’s falsely believed that marrying a girl early protects her from sexual violence or brings honor to the family. But in reality, it strips her of her freedom and future.</p>

      <h2>Consequences</h2>
      <p>Child brides face devastating health, emotional, and social consequences. They’re often pulled out of school, trapped in cycles of domestic labor, and forced into early pregnancies that can lead to complications or even death. The emotional trauma, lack of independence, and loss of identity can last a lifetime.</p>

      <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
      <p>Ending child marriage requires education, empowerment, and legal enforcement. Governments, communities, and individuals must work together to support girls’ education, raise awareness, and challenge the norms that allow this injustice to persist. Each girl deserves a chance to dream — and time to grow before marriage.</p>
